Hereâ€™s a guide to building the Product Management System in Laravel according to the provided requirements.

### Steps to Build and Organize Your Laravel Project

1. **Create a Fresh Laravel Project**

    - Create a new Laravel project (e.g., `laravel new product-management`) and initialize a Git repository.
    - Create a new GitHub repository, add your remote, and make your first commit with a clean Laravel structure.

2. **Configure the Product Table and Migration**

    - Run the following to create a `Product` model and migration:
        ```bash
        php artisan make:model Product -m
        ```
    - In the migration file, define the columns as specified:
        ```php
        public function up()
        {
            Schema::create('products', function (Blueprint $table) {
                $table->id();
                $table->string('product_id')->unique();
                $table->string('name');
                $table->text('description')->nullable();
                $table->decimal('price', 8, 2);
                $table->integer('stock')->nullable();
                $table->string('image')->nullable();
                $table->timestamps();
            });
        }
        ```
    - Run `php artisan migrate` to set up the database table.

3. **Routes Setup**

    - Define routes in `web.php` according to the operations:
        ```php
        Route::resource('products', ProductController::class);
        ```

4. **ProductController Implementation**

    - Create the `ProductController`:
        ```bash
        php artisan make:controller ProductController --resource
        ```
    - Implement controller methods to handle CRUD operations with minimal code:
        - `index()`: Fetch and display all products with pagination, sorting, and search functionality.
        - `create()`: Show the product creation form.
        - `store()`: Validate and store the new product.
        - `show($id)`: Display a specific product.
        - `edit($id)`: Show the edit form for a product.
        - `update($id)`: Update an existing product.
        - `destroy($id)`: Delete a product.

5. **Views**

    - Create the necessary Blade views under `resources/views/products`:
        - `index.blade.php`: Display products with pagination, sorting by name and price, and a search bar.
        - `create.blade.php`: Form to create a product.
        - `edit.blade.php`: Form to edit a product.
        - `show.blade.php`: View a product's details.

6. **Sorting and Searching**

    - Add sorting links in `index.blade.php`:
        ```php
        <a href="{{ route('products.index', ['sort' => 'name']) }}">Sort by Name</a>
        <a href="{{ route('products.index', ['sort' => 'price']) }}">Sort by Price</a>
        ```
    - Implement search functionality by `product_id` or `description` with a search form in `index.blade.php`.

7. **GitHub Submission**
    - Ensure your project root directory directly contains Laravel files.
    - Commit your changes and push them to the newly created GitHub repository.
    - Submit the GitHub link as required.

Following these steps will help you complete the task efficiently, adhering to the submission guidelines. Let me know if you'd like more details on any part!
